    "# Strategy to Develop Free but Profitable Apps in the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use our app — the more users that see and engage with the ads, the better. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. <br>\n",
    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, these are two data sets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).\n",

    "Because our end goal is to add the app on both Google Play and the App Store, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that works well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.\n",

    "Let's begin the analysis by getting a sense of what are the most common genres for each market. For this, we'll need to build frequency tables for the `prime_genre` column of the App Store data set, and for the `Genres` and `Category` columns of the Google Play data set.<br>\n",
